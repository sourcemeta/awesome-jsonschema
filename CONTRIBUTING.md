# Contributing

If you know of a resource discussing JSON Schema or have created a tool or
website about JSON Schema, [open a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/jviotti/awesome-jsonschema/issues/new/choose) or
add it directly to
[`data.yaml`](https://github.com/jviotti/awesome-jsonschema/blob/master/data.yaml)
The README is auto-generated from `data.yaml`. You
can render the README as follows:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
and then send a pull request.
