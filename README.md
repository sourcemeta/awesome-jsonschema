## Papers

- (2024) [Validation of Modern JSON Schema: Formalization and Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10034?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - In this paper, we give the first formal description of Modern JSON Schema, which we consider a central contribution of the work that we present here. We then prove that its data validation problem is PSPACE-complete. We prove that the origin of the problem lies in dynamic references, and not in annotation-dependent validation. We study the schema and data complexities, showing that the problem is PSPACE-complete with respect to the schema size even with a fixed instance, but is in PTIME when the schema is fixed and only the instance size is allowed to vary. Finally, we run experiments that show that there are families of schemas where the difference in asymptotic complexity between dynamic and static references is extremely visible, even with small schemas..

- (2022) [Witness Generation for JSON Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12849?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - JSON Schema is an important, evolving standard schema language for families of JSON documents. It is based on a complex combination of structural and Boolean assertions, and features negation and recursion. The static analysis of JSON Schema documents comprises practically relevant problems, including schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence. These three problems can be reduced to witness generation: given a schema, generate an element of the schema, if it exists, and report failure otherwise.
- (2022) [Validating Streaming JSON Documents with Learned VPAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08891?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper presents a new streaming algorithm to validate JSON documents against a set of constraints given as a JSON schema. It proves that there always exists a visibly pushdown automaton (VPA) that accepts the same set of JSON documents as a JSON schema.
- (2022) [The Usage of Negation in Real-World JSON Schema Documents](http://bilioso.isti.cnr.it/sebd2022/preprint/SEBD_2022_Camera-ready_PDF_8.pdf?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - Many software tools, but also formal frameworks for working with JSON Schema, do not fully support negation. This motivates us to study whether negation is actually used in practice, for which aims, and whether it could, in principle, be replaced by simpler operators. We have collected a large corpus of 80k open source JSON Schema documents. We perform a systematic analysis, quantify usage patterns of negation, and also qualitatively analyze schemas. We show that negation is indeed used, albeit infrequently, following a stable set of patterns.

- (2022) [Implicit JSON Schema Versioning Triggered by Temporal Updates to JSON-Based Big Data in the τJSchema Framework](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-07969-6_3?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper proposes an approach for handling implicit schema changes triggered by temporal updates of JSON-based Big Data. More precisely, when a user specifies a temporal JSON update operation that modifies a snapshot JSON component assigning a valid-time timestamp to its new value, the execution of such an operation requires the JSON component to become temporal, which is for all intents a schema change. Thus, a new version of the τJSchema temporal characteristics document is generated, with the addition of a new valid-time characteristic. New versions of the temporal JSON schema and of the temporal JSON document are also accordingly created.

Given a pair of schemas, our approach first canonicalizes and simplifies both schemas, then decides the subschema question on the canonical forms, dispatching simpler subschema queries to type-specific checkers.

Aggregation operations are considered in order to obtain a schema for each distinct structure in the collection, and a hierarchical data structure is proposed to group these schemas in order to generate a global schema in JSON Schema format.
- (2017) [Schema Inference for Massive JSON Datasets](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01491765?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - Recent years have seen the widespread use of JSON as a data format to represent massive data collections. JSON data collections are usually schemaless. While this ensures several advantages, the absence of schema information has important negative consequences: the correctness of complex queries and programs cannot be statically checked, users cannot rely on schema information to quickly figure out structural properties that could speed up the formulation of correct queries, and many schema-based optimizations are not possible. In this paper we deal with the problem of inferring a schema from massive JSON data sets.

A tool implementing our approach and a community-driven repository for the discovered APIs are also presented.
- (2017) [Definition of REST web services with JSON schema](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.2466?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - The aim of this article is to demonstrate how JSON Schema, and particularly the JSON Hyper Schema extension, is suitable to describe JSON-based web services that follow the REST architectural pattern.
- (2016) [τJSchema: A Framework for Managing Temporal JSON-Based NoSQL Databases](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44406-2_13?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper proposes a framework called Temporal JSON Schema (τJSchema), inspired by the τXSchema framework defined for XML data. τJSchema allows defining a temporal JSON schema from a conventional JSON schema and a set of temporal logical and physical characteristics. Our framework guarantees logical and physical data independence for temporal schemas and provides a low-impact solution since it requires neither modifications of existing JSON documents, nor extensions to the JSON format, the JSON Schema language, and all related tools and languages.

Based on the extracted schema information, we propose set of similarity measures that capture the degree of heterogeneity of JSON data and which reveal structural outliers in the data.
- (2014) [Jsongen: a quickcheck based library for testing JSON web services](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2633448.2633454?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This article describes a systematic approach to testing behavioural aspects of Web Services that communicate using the JSON data format. To generate random JSON data for populating tests we have developed a new library, jsongen, which given a characterisation of the JSON data as a JSON schema, (i) automatically derives a QuickCheck generator which can generate an infinite number of JSON values that validate against the schema, and (ii) provides a generic QuickCheck state machine which is capable of following the (hyper)links documented in the JSON schema, to automatically explore the web service.
