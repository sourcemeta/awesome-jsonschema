## Papers

- (2025) [Blaze: Compiling JSON Schema for 10x Faster Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02770?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper introduces Blaze, a JSON Schema validator compiles complex schemas to an efficient representation in seconds to minutes, adding minimal overhead at build time. Blaze incorporates several unique optimizations to reduce the validation time by an average of approximately 10x compared existing validators on a variety of datasets. In some cases, Blaze achieves a reduction in validation time of multiple orders of magnitude compared to the next fastest validator. We also demonstrate that several popular validators produce incorrect results in some cases, while Blaze maintains strict adherence to the JSON Schema specification..
- (2025) [Elimination of annotation dependencies in validation for Modern JSON Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11288?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper proves that the elimination of annotation dependent keywords cannot, in general, avoid an exponential increase of the schema dimension. We provide an algorithm to eliminate these keywords that, despite the theoretical lower bound, behaves quite well in practice, as we verify with an extensive set of experiments..
- (2025) [JSONSchemaBench: A Rigorous Benchmark of Structured Outputs for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10868?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper introduces JSONSchemaBench, a benchmark for constrained decoding comprising 10K real-world JSON schemas that encompass a wide range of constraints with varying complexity. We pair the benchmark with the existing official JSON Schema Test Suite and evaluate six state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks, including Guidance, Outlines, Llamacpp, XGrammar, OpenAI, and Gemini. Through extensive experiments, we gain insights into the capabilities and limitations of constrained decoding on structured generation with real-world JSON schemas..
- (2024) [Validation of Modern JSON Schema: Formalization and Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10034?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - In this paper, we give the first formal description of Modern JSON Schema, which we consider a central contribution of the work that we present here. We then prove that its data validation problem is PSPACE-complete. We prove that the origin of the problem lies in dynamic references, and not in annotation-dependent validation. We study the schema and data complexities, showing that the problem is PSPACE-complete with respect to the schema size even with a fixed instance, but is in PTIME when the schema is fixed and only the instance size is allowed to vary. Finally, we run experiments that show that there are families of schemas where the difference in asymptotic complexity between dynamic and static references is extremely visible, even with small schemas..

More precisely, when a user specifies a temporal JSON update operation that modifies a snapshot JSON component assigning a valid-time timestamp to its new value, the execution of such an operation requires the JSON component to become temporal, which is for all intents a schema change. Thus, a new version of the τJSchema temporal characteristics document is generated, with the addition of a new valid-time characteristic. New versions of the temporal JSON schema and of the temporal JSON document are also accordingly created.

Includes an algebraic reformulation of JSON Schema and a prototype system for generating schema witnesses.
- (2022) [The Usage of Negation in Real-World JSON Schema Documents](http://bilioso.isti.cnr.it/sebd2022/preprint/SEBD_2022_Camera-ready_PDF_8.pdf?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - Many software tools, but also formal frameworks for working with JSON Schema, do not fully support negation. This motivates us to study whether negation is actually used in practice, for which aims, and whether it could, in principle, be replaced by simpler operators. We have collected a large corpus of 80k open source JSON Schema documents. We perform a systematic analysis, quantify usage patterns of negation, and also qualitatively analyze schemas. We show that negation is indeed used, albeit infrequently, following a stable set of patterns.
- (2022) [Validating Streaming JSON Documents with Learned VPAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08891?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - This paper presents a new streaming algorithm to validate JSON documents against a set of constraints given as a JSON schema.

- (2022) [Witness Generation for JSON Schema](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12849?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - JSON Schema is an important, evolving standard schema language for families of JSON documents. It is based on a complex combination of structural and Boolean assertions, and features negation and recursion. The static analysis of JSON Schema documents comprises practically relevant problems, including schema satisfiability, inclusion, and equivalence. These three problems can be reduced to witness generation: given a schema, generate an element of the schema, if it exists, and report failure otherwise.

- (2017) [Schema Inference for Massive JSON Datasets](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01491765?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - Recent years have seen the widespread use of JSON as a data format to represent massive data collections. JSON data collections are usually schemaless. While this ensures several advantages, the absence of schema information has important negative consequences: the correctness of complex queries and programs cannot be statically checked, users cannot rely on schema information to quickly figure out structural properties that could speed up the formulation of correct queries, and many schema-based optimizations are not possible. In this paper we deal with the problem of inferring a schema from massive JSON data sets.
- (2016) [Foundations of JSON Schema](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2872427.2883029?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - In this paper we provide the first formal definition of syntax and semantics for JSON Schema and use it to show that implementing this layer on top of JSON is feasible in practice.

Our framework guarantees logical and physical data independence for temporal schemas and provides a low-impact solution since it requires neither modifications of existing JSON documents, nor extensions to the JSON format, the JSON Schema language, and all related tools and languages.
- (2015) [Schema extraction and structural outlier detection for JSON-based nosql data stores](https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/2420?utm_source=awesome-jsonschema) - Rather than designing the schema up front, extracting a schema in hindsight can be seen as a reverse-engineering step. Based on the extracted schema information, we propose set of similarity measures that capture the degree of heterogeneity of JSON data and which reveal structural outliers in the data.

To generate random JSON data for populating tests we have developed a new library, jsongen, which given a characterisation of the JSON data as a JSON schema, (i) automatically derives a QuickCheck generator which can generate an infinite number of JSON values that validate against the schema, and (ii) provides a generic QuickCheck state machine which is capable of following the (hyper)links documented in the JSON schema, to automatically explore the web service.

Secondly, transformations of the derived schemas to different technical spaces are utilized, thereby allowing, amongst other benefits, the application of established integration tools and methods. Finally, as a case study, schemas are derived for Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn.

## Libraries

The JSON Schema website includes an extensive list of implementations and
related libraries: https://json-schema.org/implementations.html. Check out the
